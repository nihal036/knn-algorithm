"""- 150 **observations**
- 4 **features** (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)

# Training a machine learning model with scikit-learn

## Agenda

- What is the **K-nearest neighbors** classification model?
- What are the four steps for **model training and prediction** in scikit-learn?
- How can I apply this pattern to **other machine learning models**?

## K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification
